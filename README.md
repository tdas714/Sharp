### News you can trust.

This is a decentralized Blockchain based News platform for the masses. Our Goal is to free  the people from the clutches of the Mainstream Media. 

We will achieve this by providing a decentralized platform where news can be submitted, curated, and voted on by our users. We will also provide a platform for our users to earn cryptocurrency for curating  news and voting on news. The problem with our mainstream media or social media today are that they are centralized. They are controlled by a few people who have a vested interest in what they report. They are also controlled by the advertisers who pay them to report on certain things. This is why we have fake news. This is why we have propaganda. This is why we have censorship. 

A single institution/Individual shouldn't decide what  news we should read. We should decide for ourselves.   Journalists are not safe from governments for taking the truth to the public, Truth almost became privilege  in the past few years. We believe everyone    should have the right to know the truth. We believe in a decentralized society where the people will decide the truth. The truth is not decided by a few people. 

We trying to solve the problem by decentralizing the news. we will do this by creating a platform where anyone can submit news, and anyone can vote on it. The people will decide the news they want to read. There will be no censorship.

we welcome every developer, blockchain expert,  journalist to collaborate on this  project. So that we can build a truly decentralized news platform.
